# Who wanna be a policeman / Кто хочет быть милиционером?

The project demonstrates TDD(Test Driven Development) and BDD(Behavior-driven development) approaches.
As a base I have taken a game idea that is similar to "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?".
The goal of player is to answer to set of questions about work in police. You have 4 answers to each question, only one of them is correct. Also you can use one-off tips/hints in difficult situations.
